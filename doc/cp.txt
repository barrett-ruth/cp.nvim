INTRODUCTION						*cp* *cp.nvim*

cp.nvim is a competitive programming plugin that automates problem setup,
compilation, and testing workflow for online judges.

Supported platforms: AtCoder, Codeforces, CSES
Supported languages: C++, Python

REQUIREMENTS						*cp-requirements*

- Neovim 0.10.0+
- uv package manager (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Language runtime/compiler (g++, python3)

Optional:
- LuaSnip for template expansion (https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)

COMMANDS						*cp-commands*

								*:CP*
cp.nvim uses a single :CP command with intelligent argument parsing:

Setup Commands ~

:CP {platform} {contest_id} {problem_id}
                                Full setup: set platform, load contest metadata,
                                and set up specific problem. Scrapes test cases
                                and creates source file.
                                Example: :CP codeforces 1933 a

:CP {platform} {contest_id}     Contest setup: set platform and load contest
                                metadata for navigation. Caches problem list.
                                Example: :CP atcoder abc324

:CP {platform}                  Platform setup: set platform only.
                                Example: :CP cses

:CP {problem_id}                Problem switch: switch to different problem
                                within current contest context.
                                Example: :CP b (switch to problem b)

Action Commands ~

:CP run                         Compile and run current problem with test input.
                                Shows execution time and output comparison.

:CP debug                       Compile with debug flags and run current problem.
                                Includes sanitizers and debug symbols.

:CP diff                        Enter diff mode to compare actual vs expected
                                output. Run again to exit diff mode.

Navigation Commands ~

:CP next                        Navigate to next problem in current contest.
                                Stops at last problem (no wrapping).

:CP prev                        Navigate to previous problem in current contest.
                                Stops at first problem (no wrapping).

CONFIGURATION						*cp-config*

cp.nvim works out of the box. No setup required.

Optional configuration with lazy.nvim: >
    {
        'barrett-ruth/cp.nvim',
        cmd = 'CP',
        opts = {
          debug = false,
          contests = {
            default = {
              cpp_version = 20,
              compile_flags = { "-O2", "-DLOCAL", "-Wall", "-Wextra" },
              debug_flags = { "-g3", "-fsanitize=address,undefined", "-DLOCAL" },
              timeout_ms = 2000,
            },
            atcoder = { cpp_version = 23 },
          },
          hooks = {
            before_run = function(problem_id) vim.cmd.w() end,
            before_debug = function(problem_id) ... end,
          },
          tile = function(source_buf, input_buf, output_buf)
          end,
          filename = function(contest, problem_id, problem_letter)
          end,
        }
    }

WORKFLOW						*cp-workflow*

For the sake of consistency and simplicity, cp.nvim extracts contest/problem identifiers from
URLs. This means that, for example, CodeForces/AtCoder contests are configured by
their round id rather than round number. See below.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC USAGE					*cp-platforms*

AtCoder ~
									*cp-atcoder*
URL format: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc123/tasks/abc123_a

In terms of cp.nvim, this corresponds to:
- Platform: atcoder
- Contest ID: abc123
- Problem ID: a

Usage examples: >
    :CP atcoder abc123 a        " Full setup: problem A from contest ABC123
    :CP atcoder abc123          " Contest setup: load contest metadata only
    :CP b                       " Switch to problem B (if contest loaded)
    :CP next                    " Navigate to next problem in contest
<
Codeforces ~
									*cp-codeforces*
URL format: https://codeforces.com/contest/1234/problem/A

In terms of cp.nvim, this corresponds to:
- Platform: codeforces
- Contest ID: 1234
- Problem ID: a (lowercase)

Usage examples: >
    :CP codeforces 1934 a       " Full setup: problem A from contest 1934
    :CP codeforces 1934         " Contest setup: load contest metadata only
    :CP c                       " Switch to problem C (if contest loaded)
    :CP prev                    " Navigate to previous problem in contest
<
CSES ~
									*cp-cses*
URL format: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068

CSES is organized by categories rather than contests. Currently all problems
are grouped under "CSES Problem Set" category.

In terms of cp.nvim, this corresponds to:
- Platform: cses
- Contest ID: "CSES Problem Set" (category)
- Problem ID: 1068 (numeric)

Usage examples: >
    :CP cses 1068               " Set up problem 1068 from CSES
    :CP 1070                    " Switch to problem 1070 (if CSES loaded)
    :CP next                    " Navigate to next problem in CSES
<
COMPLETE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE					*cp-example*

Example: Setting up and solving AtCoder contest ABC324

1. Browse to https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc324
2. Set up contest and load metadata: >
    :CP atcoder abc324
<   This caches all problems (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) for navigation

3. Start with problem A: >
    :CP a
<   This creates abc324a.cc and scrapes test cases

4. Code your solution, then test: >
    :CP run
<
5. If needed, debug: >
    :CP debug
<
6. Compare output visually: >
    :CP diff
<
7. Move to next problem: >
    :CP next
<   This automatically sets up problem B

8. Continue solving problems with :CP next/:CP prev navigation
9. Submit solutions on AtCoder website

Example: Quick setup for single Codeforces problem >
    :CP codeforces 1933 a       " One command setup
    :CP run                     " Test immediately
<

FILE STRUCTURE						*cp-files*

cp.nvim creates the following file structure upon problem setup:

    {contest_id}{problem_id}.cc     " Source file (e.g. abc324a.cc)
    build/
      {contest_id}{problem_id}.run  " Compiled binary
    io/
      {contest_id}{problem_id}.in       " Test input
      {contest_id}{problem_id}.out      " Program output
      {contest_id}{problem_id}.expected " Expected output

The plugin automatically manages this structure and navigation between problems
maintains proper file associations.

SNIPPETS						*cp-snippets*

cp.nvim integrates with LuaSnip for automatic template expansion. When you
open a new problem file, type the contest name and press <Tab> to expand.

Built-in snippets include basic C++ templates for each contest type.
Custom snippets can be added via configuration.

HEALTH CHECK						*cp-health*

Run |:checkhealth| cp to verify your setup.
