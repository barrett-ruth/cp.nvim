Also, we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books, and other materials, learn a concept, and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <strong>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem. <\/strong>All the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"..\/codeofconduct\">CodeChef's Code Of Conduct<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Rules and Regulations:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an IOI-style contest.
