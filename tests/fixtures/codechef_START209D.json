Also, we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books, and other materials, learn a concept, and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <strong>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem. <\/strong>All the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"..\/codeofconduct\">CodeChef's Code Of Conduct<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Rules and Regulations:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an IOI-style contest. This means that the problems will be partially graded. You will get the score for passing certain test data.<\/li>\n<li>The details of the failed test cases will also be visible on your solution page.<\/li>\n<li>You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties for incorrect submissions. Only your best correct submission will be considered.<\/li>\n<li>Those who achieve the score first will be placed higher in the ranklist in case of a tie.<\/li>\n<li><strong>We have removed all the Institutions that we could not identify from our database. We request you to update your institutions once again by going to your profile page.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>You can also send in your queries in an email to <a href=\"mailto:help@codechef.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">help@codechef.com<\/a>, during the contest.<\/li>\n<li>Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions, or tips in the comments during a live contest. Posting questions clarifying the problem statement is ok. If you are unsure, email us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@codechef.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> feedback@codechef.com<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Discussing CodeChef's problems or any aspect of a problem, on any other platform on the web, on identification, could lead to the disabling of the respective account and banning from the community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note: You can now \"Code, Compile, and Run\" your codes on our <a href=\"..\/ide\">Online IDE<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, if you are using any other online development environment, make sure that other contestants don't have access to your code.
