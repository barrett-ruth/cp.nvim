## Quick Start

cp.nvim follows a simple principle: **solve locally, submit remotely**.

### Basic Usage

1. Find a contest or problem
2. Set up contests locally

   ```
   :CP codeforces 1848
   ```

3. Code and test

   ```
   :CP run
   ```

4. Navigate between problems

   ```
   :CP next
   :CP prev
   :CP e1
   ```

5. Debug and edit test cases

```
:CP edit
:CP panel --debug
```

5. Submit on the original website
